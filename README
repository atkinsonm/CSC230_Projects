This repository contains projects completed while enrolled in Computer Science II: Data Structures (CSC230). 
Many of these projects involve implementation if a certain data structure to solve a real world issue.

Websites: Instantiates a Reader object which inputs a file with website URLS and 
          calculates and prints the number of URLS with certain domain types
          
Interest Rates: Imports data on federal interest rates and finds the high, low, and determines if certain data
                exist in the list.
                
Simple Recursion Projects: Three activities to test recursive statements:

                          Activity1: Draw stars based on user input
                          Activity2: Determine the number of vowels in a string
                          Activity3: Determine the greatest common denominator of two integers
                          
Sorting Algorithms: Implements a bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort
                    on a sample of People objects to compare the sorting algorithms and time complexities.
                    
Decision Tree: Implements a decision tree to determine if the user is pregnant 
                (with a test approach, not serious or medically sound)
                
Minimum Spanning Tree: Implements a test graph using file input, performs a BFS and DFS, produces an adjacency matrix 
                        and a minimum spanning tree.
                        
Server Log Processing: Processes a server log, creates objects for each log entry, and outputs information about the log.

Print Manager: Simulates a variety of print jos and manages the distribution of those jobs to several
                printers based on certain criteria and the current state of the printers.
                
Hashing and DNS Queries: Makes DNS queries and hashes results

Marvel Characters: Creates an undirected graph which allows a user to search for and view relationships
                    between characters in the Marvel universe.
